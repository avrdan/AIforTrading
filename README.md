# Artificial Intelligence for Trading

This work is part of the Udacity Nanodegree of the same name.
It includes trading Algorithms that use ML, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
**Python** has been used as the main language and **PyTorch** as the primary **Deep Learning** library.

The project work/submissions have been added in the respective sections.
Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that can be opened statically (file with extension **.ipynb**).

The nanogree was split in two parts, covering the following topics:


## PART 1
### Quantitative Trading
Learn the basics of quantitative analysis, including data processing, trading signal generation, and portfolio management. Use Python to work with historical stock data, develop trading strategies, and construct a multi-factor model with optimization.

* Project: Trading with Momentum
* Project: Breakout Strategy
* Project: Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization
* Project: Multi-factor Model

## PART 2
### AI Algorithms in Trading
Learn how to analyze alternative data and use machine learning to generate trading signals. Run a backtest to evaluate and combine top performing signals.

* Project: NLP on Financial Statements
* Project: Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks
* Project: Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha
* Project: Backtesting
